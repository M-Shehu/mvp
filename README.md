## ü§î What is Sprise Hub? ##
Glad you asked! Have you ever faced either of these 3 dilemmas?
- How do I give someone a memoriable surprise?
- How can I make a walk or run more interesting?
- How can I get random tips and tricks from complete strangers?

Look no further because Sprise Hub got you covered. So what exactly can you do?

### Special Sprise
You can customise a special page to surprise someone special on an event. Set up ~~surprises~~ sprises the person looks forward to throughout the day.

### Sprise Hunt
You can set up an interesting sprise hunt around the city and let people find all the clues or go on a sprise hunt yourself. Its meant to make your run or commute to work more fun. The more interesting your custom sprise hunt, the more popular it gets.

### Insta Sprise
Get a random sprise from anyone in the world by shaking your device. *SpriseHub is not liable for any damage caused from shaking phones, laptops or desktops.* Could it be a nice message, a tip and trick, a diss and obscure fact? Dunno. That's the sprise. Leave your sprise on there as well to get random people to see it.

## üåê How Do I Use Sprise Hub? ##
Go to www.sprisehub.com and sign up. It's as easy as a shake to use from there on out. Go have fun getting sprised and sprising others.
